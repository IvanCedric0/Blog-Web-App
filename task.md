# Tracks For My Blog project

I've been working on this *capstone project* for 3 weeks now and now that I have 2 PCs now, it means that I'll be pushing code from these two compters. Therefore, I decided to learn the **Markdown language** in order to track my progress and plan the tasks i'll be working on.
